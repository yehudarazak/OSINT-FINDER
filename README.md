# Quick OSINT CLI

A simple and efficient command-line tool for performing Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) tasks from the terminal. The tool is designed to quickly gather domain information, check for data breaches, scan social media for username mentions, and more.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> This tool is still in development and does not fully function yet. Some features may be incomplete, non-functional, or require further testing. Use at your own risk.

## Features (WIP)

- **Domain Information Lookup** (Partially implemented)  
  Retrieve WHOIS information, DNS records, and subdomains for any given domain.
  
- **Breached Data Search** (Experimental)  
  Search for compromised data associated with an email address and get details of the breach.

- **Social Media Mention Scanner** (Under development)  
  Scan social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Instagram for mentions of a username or keyword.

- **File Metadata Extraction** (Planned)  
  Extract EXIF metadata from images and PDFs to uncover hidden details like creation dates and geolocation.

- **Geolocation Lookup** (Not implemented yet)  
  Perform IP geolocation queries to track the origin of an IP address.
